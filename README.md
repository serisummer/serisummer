## *Hello, Weiguang here, I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at UC IrvineðŸ‘‹*
<p>As I was just tapping into the world of computers, I didn't have clear goals and was struggling a lot. It's a difficult field of study but as my knowledge regarding computer science expands, my curiosity in technology is ever expaning as well. It gave me the persistence, strength, and courage to withstand the constant depression and misery as I complete my degree (not as miserable as before because I became more kownledgeable and I went to therapy :D mental health is important!) And now I enjoy studying computer science a lot, it's almsot therapeutic to me now!</p>
<p>More exciting projects coming up soon!</p>

My Skills:
- Java
- C/C++
- Python
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- SQL
- Git/Github
